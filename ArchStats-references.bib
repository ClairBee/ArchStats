  Abstract                 = {Determining the nature of the connection between a number of factors and the spread of a directional response in industrial experiments has not been considered much in the literature. Several dispersion measures are explored and their relationships described. The circular variance is a good dispersion measure that transforms the angular dispersion into a statistic measured on a linear scale. Once this transformation has been performed, established techniques for analysis can be employed for analysing factor influences on the directional dispersion. The method proposed is used to analyse data from an experiment involving the balancing of automotive flywheels.},

  Abstract                 = {Very often, the likelihoods for circular data sets are of quite complicated forms, and the functional forms of the normalising constants, which depend upon the unknown parameters, are unknown. This latter problem generally precludes rigorous, exact inference (both classical and Bayesian) for circular data. Noting the paucity of literature on Bayesian circular data analysis, and also because realistic data analysis is naturally permitted by the Bayesian paradigm, we address the above problem taking a Bayesian perspective. In particular, we propose a methodology that combines importance sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in a very effective manner to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters, given the circular data. With simulation study and real data analysis, we demonstrate the considerable reliability and flexibility of our proposed methodology in analysing circular data.},

Appropriate regression diagnostics, estimation and testing procedures are developed for fitting the models. The meaning of "correlation" between an angular and a linear variable is clarified, and leads to a general notion of multiple correlation associated with the regression model. The methods are applied to a set of data arising from a study of movements of intertidal gastropods.},

The central distribution for the circular case is von Mises distribution which has two parameters (mean and concentration) akin to the univariate normal distribution. However, there has been a challenge to sample efficiently from the posterior distribution of the concentration parameter. We describe a novel, highly efficient algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution and fill this long-standing gap. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

The approach is Bayesian and is aimed at examining plausible values for the megalithic quantum rather than at proving or refuting any particular value. It is shown that the technique has some appealing properties not possessed by previous analyses. For the stone circles, several subsets of the total data set are investigated and the results confirm Kendall's conclusion that the evidence for the megalithic yard, such as it is, resides almost entirely in the data from Scotland. Even here, two other values are found which fit the data almost as well as the yard. For the stone rows, however, no evidence is found for the existence of a single quantal value and Thom's claim for the use of a unit of 21/2 megalithic yards is not supported.},

  Abstract                 = {Consider a process of events on a line L, where, for the most part, the events occur randomly in both time and location. A scatterplot of the pair that represents position on the line, and occurrence time, will resemble a bivariate stochastic point process in a plane, P say. If, however, some of the points on L arise through a more regular phenomenon which travels along the line at an approximately constant speed, creating new points as it goes, then the corresponding points in P will occur roughly in a straight line. It is of interest to locate such lines, and thereby identify, as nearly as possible, the points on L which are associated with the (approximately) constant-velocity process. Such a problem arises in connection with the study of seismic data, where L represents a fault-line and the constant-velocity process there results from the steady diffusion of stress. We suggest methodology for solving this needle-in-a-haystack problem, and discuss its properties. The technique is applied to both simulated and real data. In the latter case it draws particular attention to events occurring along the San Andreas fault, in the vicinity of Parkville, California, on 5 April 1995.},

  Abstract                 = {The EM algorithm is the standard method for estimating the parameters in finite mixture models. Yang and Pan [25] proposed a generalized classification maximum likelihood procedure, called the fuzzy c-directions (FCD) clustering algorithm, for estimating the parameters in mixtures of von Mises distributions. Two main drawbacks of the EM algorithm are its slow convergence and the dependence of the solution on the initial value used. The choice of initial values is of great importance in the algorithm-based literature as it can heavily influence the speed of convergence of the algorithm and its ability to locate the global maximum. On the other hand, the algorithmic frameworks of EM and FCD are closely related. Therefore, the drawbacks of FCD are the same as those of the EM algorithm. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes another clustering algorithm, which can self-organize local optimal cluster numbers without using cluster validity functions. These numerical results clearly },

  Abstract                 = {Thom considers that many of the dimensions of megalithic sites can be expressed in terms of a quantum of 5.44 ft (1.66 m). The problem of detecting a quantum when its size is not known in advance has been studied in pioneer papers by Broadbent (1955, 1956). With the greatly increased volume of evidence now available, a renewed attack on this problem seems called for, and a new approach, based on a Fourier analysis, will be outlined here. With samples of sufficient size, testing for the presence of a quantum is equivalent to testing a section of a realization of a Gaussian stochastic process, stationary under time shifts, for an unduly large supremum. If the test is not to be prejudiced by prior decisions about the fittings of `eggs', `fans', etc., then only data from circle-diameters can be used. This reduces the sample size, and so the asymptotic theory has to be supplemented by `Monte Carlo' runs with simulated data (with and without a built-in quantum effect). It already seems clear that agreement on the data-set to be used in the analysis is the vital prerequisite for a decisive test of the quantum hypothesis.},

This problem is solved by the introduction of a plot to be called the pontogram and by the introduction of simulation-based significance tests constructed by random lateral perturbations of the data.},

Three existing MCMC methods (Gibbs, Metropolis-Hastings, and Rejection) for a single group of circular data were extended to be used in a between-subjects design, providing a novel procedure to compare groups of circular data. Investigating the performance of the methods by simulation study, all methods were found to overestimate the concentration parameter of the posterior, while coverage was reasonable. The rejection sampler performed best. In future research, the MCMC method may be extended to include covariates, or a within-subjects design.},

  Abstract                 = {This methodological paper uses the measurements of the Early Iron Age Toumba building at Lefkandi to study whether a single design-unit can be detected in the data set. Cosine quantogram analysis is used in the initial analysis of the building dimensions and, in the second phase, the relevance of the obtained results is calculated by using Monte Carlo computer simulations. A statistically significant unit of c. 49 cm can be isolated, but because of the very limited number of precise dimensions, this result should only be accepted with caution. The case study demonstrates how the complex statistical problem of deriving the lengths of possibly used design-units in ancient architecture can be approached; metrological analyses can only gain from employing appropriate quantitative methods. /// ?? ????? ????? ???????????? ???????????? ??? ????????? ??? ?? ?????? ??? ??????? ?????? ??? ??????? ???? ????? ??? ???????? ??? ?? ????????? ??? ?????? ?? ?????????? ??? ?????? ??? ????????? ??? ?????? ?????? ??????????. ??? ??? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?????????? ??? ??????? ??????????? ? ?????????? ???????

For problem (i) if $D_{1},\ldots ,D_{n}$ are the sample arc-lengths made by a random sample of size n, we discuss in Sections 1 and 2 some tests based symmetrically on $\{D_{i}\}$ and comment on their asymptotic efficiencies. Section 3 deals with comparison of two circular populations for which we suggest a test called the V-test which is shown to be asymptotically superior to the standard Run test for the circle (see for instance David and Barton (1962)).},

While much of this theory is connected by common geometrical concepts the applications have been widespread. This paper is therefore an attempt to collect research activities that up until recently have been conducted in relative isolation and to present the methods in a critical light. The paper concentrates largely on a perspective of the statistics of shape identified with the 'D.G. Kendall School'. However, Bookstein's approach to shape analysis is also considered and compared with the Kendall approach. Examples are given of applications in archaeology, astronomy and the biological sciences. /// Dans cet article nous examinons quelques travaux r?cents relatifs ? la theorie de la statistique des formes et ? ses applications, pour des distributions al?atoires de points.

  Abstract                 = {Common cluster models for multi-type point processes model the aggregation of points of the same type. In complete contrast, in the study of Anglo-Saxon settlements it is hypothesized that administrative clusters involving complementary names tend to appear. We investigate the evidence for such an hypothesis by developing a Bayesian Random Partition Model based on clusters formed by points of different types (complementary clustering). As a result we obtain an intractable posterior distribution on the space of matchings contained in a k-partite hypergraph. We apply the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm to sample from this posterior. We consider the problem of choosing an efficient MH proposal distribution and we obtain consistent mixing improvements compared to the choices found in the literature. Simulated Tempering techniques can be used to overcome multimodality and a multiple proposal scheme is developed to allow for parallel programming. Finally, we discuss results arising from the careful use of convergence diagnostic techniques. This allows us to study a dataset including locations and placenames of 1316 Anglo-Saxon settlements dated approximately around 750-850 AD. Without strong prior knowledge, the model allows for explicit estimation of the number of clusters, the average intra-cluster dispersion and the level of interaction among placenames. The results support the hypothesis of organization of settlements into administrative clusters based on complementary names.},
