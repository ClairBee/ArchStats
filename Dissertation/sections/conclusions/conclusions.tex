\section{Summary & Conclusions}

\nb{von Mises distribution is not generally the best fit because it is unable to deal with the combination of uniform `noise' points and concentrated spikes that we tend to see arising from this type of data. A Jones-Pewsey may fit the data better, but can generally be replaced with a mixture of von Mises distributions. While a $k$-von Mises mixture may be the absolute best fit of the candidate models to the data, a more useful model in terms of interpretation is probably one in which one component is fixed as a circular uniform distribution, describing the density of those points that can't be said to belong to any particular orientation.}

\todo{Give a summary of the procedure used: cleaning the data to extract post-holes, identifying orientation, identifying gridding (rather than a single dominant linear direction), identifying gridding across the whole site}
