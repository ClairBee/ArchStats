\section{Conclusions}

The procedure applied in both of the case studies is summarised in Algorithm~\ref{alg:procedure}. \nb{Flowchart may be preferable?}

\begin{algorithm}[h!]
    \caption{Outline procedure to identify evidence of gridding}
	\label{alg:procedure}
	
\eIf{Data is uniformly distributed}{
	There is no common orientation
}
%	\eIf{Data is skewed}{
A single von Mises component cannot explain the shape. Try to fit a u-vM mixture model with 3 components.
%	}




\end{algorithm}

\todo{Give a summary of the procedure used: cleaning the data to extract post-holes, identifying orientation, identifying gridding (rather than a single dominant linear direction), identifying gridding across the whole site}
