\section{Case Study 1: Genlis}
\label{sec:CS1}

Our first case study is an excavation site in Genlis, in northern France (Figure~\ref{fig:Genlis-JPEG}). Of the site plans provided by the PEML team, this is among the smallest, with its post-hole structures generally well separated from the annotations and larger features; to the human eye, there certainly appear to sets of post-holes at right-angles to one another. For this reason we have chosen to focus first on this relatively straightforward case, before moving on to analyse a more complex site in Section~\ref{sec:CS2}.

A copy of the R code used to generate the plots and analysis can be found in Appendix \ref{app:CS1}.

%\nb{look at Fisher \cite{Fisher1985} for how to introduce \& describe a data set.}

\subsection{Converting JPEG to points}

Following the procedure given in \ref{sec:points-to-JPEG}, we import the data and convert it to a black-and-white raster object. A threshold value of 0.2 is high enough to transform the plan's background to solid white, even where text from the reverse of the scanned page has been picked up; however, a number of short smudges have been converted to black pixels.

The scale marker is used to rescale the raster's $x$ and $y$ coordinates to a more realistic scale; any measurements given in relation to the plan will therefore now be given in metres. Manual identification of the group of pixels representing the N-S marker tells us that due north lies at an angle of 1.97 radians ($113^\circ$) from the horizontal origin against which the rest of the angles are measured.

As a first step, we exclude any `sparse' features, defined as in section~\ref{sec:excl-sparse} as any feature that covers less than 55\% of the pixels in its bounding square. As Figure~\ref{fig:Genlis-f-ext-sparse-removed} shows, this process has removed most - but not all - of the numerical annotations; all of the larger features represented by lines; and the lines of the site boundary. However, we are left with a handful of letters and numbers, a few larger circular features represented by shaded circles, and the dots of the boundary line.

\subsection{Global vs local gridding}
\todo{Compare different approaches to splitting data: via midpoints or via clustering (if clustering, use same method as Catholme. Smaller $\varepsilon$ divided that large cluster into a set of smaller sub-features, which showed evidence of a common distribution but could also be considered to be part of the same feature: so common distribution is not surprising. Should therefore err on side of a large $\varepsilon$ rather than a smaller, to avoid treating parts of a larger composite feature as if they are separate parts.}

\nb{Describe the `true' underlying distribution using a mixture model obtained by EM, if possible}

\subsection{Comparison of results using different point extraction methods}
ie. how robust is the process to different starting sets of post-holes?

Data was cleaned by removing remote points \& those not appearing to be part of a regular feature. What would have been the outcome if we hadn't removed those points?

\todo{Give table of comparison}
\todo{Fit final model}

Tried using raster threshold 0.3 instead of 0.2. Picked up 268 points instead of 267.

\subsection{Evidence of consistent unit of measure?}
