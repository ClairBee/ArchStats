\section{Case Study 2: Catholme}
\label{sec:CS2}

A copy of the R code used to generate the plots and analysis can be found in Appendix \ref{app:CS2}.

\subsection{Point extraction}
\todo{Discuss difference in feature makeup between Catholme \& Genlis - results in a different set of steps. Less challenging to extract small, round post-hole features, but harder to extract pattern from the data}

\nb{Is 'sparse' the right word? Maybe non-dense}

\subsection{Fitting an angular distribution}

\subsubsection{Parameter estimation}
\subsubsection{Model selection}

\subsection{Checking for gridding vs linearity}

\subsection{Checking for evidence of global gridding}

\nb{Distribution is quite dispersed compared to the Genlis site - maybe not particularly strictly aligned to a grid? At this point, need to try removing points of aligned features \& refitting}

\subsection{Comparison of results using different point extraction methods}
ie. how robust is the process to different starting sets of post-holes?

\subsection{Evidence of consistent unit of measure?}
