\subsection{Test of method over simulated data}

\nb{More likely data set would have some noise points as well: how to add these? Uniform across whole site?}

\subsection{Robustness tests: perturbations of existing data}

\nb{Need to test how sensitive the analysis is to buildings with different orientations: for this, we will definitely need spatial clustering among related points, as well as randomised. Maybe include this as part of the 'simulations' section? Rotate part of the grid by a certain angle \& compare the results? Ideally we want the test to be quite sensitive}
