\section{Finding evidence of gridding}

\subsection{Extracting angles from post-holes}
`Doubling' the angles to allow a unimodal distribution to be fitted.

\subsection{Tests for symmetric unimodality}
Demonstrate that it's appropriate to even fit one of these distributions

What do we do if we don't find symmetry/unimodality in the data?

\subsection{Identifying the dominant direction}


\subsection{Testing for similarity of multiple distributions}

\subsubsection{Linearity vs perpendicularity}

\subsubsection{Localized vs global gridding}
