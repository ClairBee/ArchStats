\section*{Things to make \& do}
\vspace{-15pt}

\todo{Simulation-based tests using Genlis data: same distance between points, perturbation based on observed $\kappa$, same number of points observed in each cluster belonging to each. What happens if we add a number of degrees to the angles in the concentrated data? At what point are they no longer identified as identical?}

\todo{Have I adequately explained WHY each step is necessary?}

\todo{Think a glossary might be a good idea...}

\todo{Add section numbers to code}
\todo{Replace all !h with !ht}
\todo{Distribution names should be in capitals}
\todo{Check usage of the word \textcolor{red}{feature}. Should be used either to refer to a feature on a raster or a larger structure on the map - not both. Need to clarify terminology.}
\todo{List all required R packages!}

\section*{Things to mention}
\begin{itemize}

\item
Why unimodal, reflectively symmetric models? Mention this in the introduction.

\item
Have I mentioned under- or over-fitting anywhere? Think I may have used it incorrectly, if I did. Check this.

\item
Data-cleaning method given is fairly conservative as far as cleaning post-holes is concerned: you can run all steps even when they aren't necessary, and should do only a minimal amount of damage (as in Catholme site) - think I mentioned this in Catholme case study?

\item
von Mises, like the Normal distribution, is a maximum entropy distribution - another reason to make it the natural analogue. For large $\kappa$, tends to a Normal distribution with variance $1/k$ (Wallace2000).

\item
Make clear that a point's orientation is fixed, as an attribute of that point. Any subsetting, clustering etc does not result in re-measurement: $\theta_i$ and $\phi_i$ are fixed for each $i$ but the $i$ are repartitioned.

\item
 - All angular calculations are considered to be modulo $2\pi$ unless stated otherwise.\\
 - $\theta$ are considered to be continuous throughout.
 - A result will be considered significant if it holds at the 5\% level.

\item
Should be wary of reporting things to a very high degree of precision when presenting final results: we're not working from real measurements here, but from a small-scale representation, often one that has been printed \& scanned. Hopefully accurate enough within themselves, but need to bear this in mind when reporting re-scaled distances/angles.

Also gives us a rationale for looking for features along a line: centre-points are too small (single point only), post-holes are larger than this.

\item
Functions don't overwrite the existing object - have to be updated manually.
\textit{(probably mention in appendix with R code for pre-processing functions)
