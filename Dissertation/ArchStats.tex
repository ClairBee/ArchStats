\section*{Things to make \& do}
\vspace{-15pt}

\todo{\nb{Change listings settings to print R code in black \& white! Otherwise this could get v v expensive!}}

\todo{$i$ denotes an observation: a point or angle. Groups should be denoted $j$. Or vice versa. Doesn't matter, just make sure this is consistent throughout.}

\todo{Have I adequately explained WHY each step is necessary?}

\todo{Sort out spacing \& inline formatting on equations}

\todo{Distribution names: capitals or not?}

\todo{Run procedure over Brandon \& compare clustering}

\todo{Can I shrink subscript fonts?}

\todo{Need to be careful about ML vs BC estimators. Either use tilde vs hat or be stricter with BC subscript. Need to differentiate somehow.}

\todo{Create a mixture uniform \& vM with high $\kappa$: what is this identified as?}

\todo{simulate a larger site: at what point (in terms of $n$) does JP become a more viable alternative than vM? (could give single plot of all buildings, labelled, and sample stats for all of them) - need to take account of the fact that the exact distribution is likely to change with $n$}

\todo{Get wall extraction algorithm - plot robust-regression lines against adjacent points that share the global orientation \nb{surely robust regression isn't even necessary, since I know the expected angle? Just plot a line at that point instead}}

\todo{Run cluster comparison over simulated building data with many buildings}

\todo{Refer to chapters or sections? Need to decide.}

\todo{Check `in search of quanta' - how was perturbation done? What did Giacomo do? And how concrete/quantified were the conclusions there?}

\todo{Think a glossary might be a very good idea...}

\todo{Check any functions using atan2 to make sure everything is passed as y, x. Otherwise, angles are measured the wrong way round.}

\section*{Things to mention}
\begin{itemize}

\item
List all required R packages!

\item
A summary `cheat sheet' showing the outline of the procedure, with appropriate R functions, is given in Appendix ??.

\item
Sizes of post-holes on maps are not necessarily representative of the sizes of the genuine post-holes \nb{at least, I assume they can't be - waiting on Chris S to confirm}, so can't use our knowledge of their expected proportions to determine an appropriate set of parameters: depends on scaling used by printer. Not to mention the resolution of the JPEG.

\item 
``Only by a doubling approach can a convenient exponential-family model be arrived at for axial data'' \cite{Arnold2011}

\item
Required level of significance: generally 5\% (also for confidence intervals)

\item
All angular calculations are considered to be modulo $2\pi$ unless stated otherwise.

\item
$\theta$ are considered to be continuous throughout.

\item
Should be wary of reporting things to a very high degree of precision when presenting final results: we're not working from real measurements here, but from a small-scale representation, often one that has been printed \& scanned. Hopefully accurate enough within themselves, but need to bear this in mind when reporting re-scaled distances/angles.

Also gives us a rationale for looking for features along a line: centre-points are too small (single point only), post-holes are larger than this.

\item
Functions don't overwrite the existing object - have to be updated manually.
\textit{(probably mention in appendix with R code for pre-processing functions)
}

\item
scale-based parameters are not generally useful, since scale is very inaccurately estimated in the plan (generally \nb{n} pixels represent 1m). Also some maps may not be rescaled, eg. if the plan doesn't have a scale marker..
